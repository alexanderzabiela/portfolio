<h3>Brandit - The Web to Print Solution</h3>

<p>Brandit is an award-winning, online brand management solution. The application
provides a user-friendly web-to-print platform that allows brands to create
multi-platform, bespoke artwork that adheres to their brand guidelines.
Over the course of 12 months, I worked on the project both backend and frontend with
a team of software engineers and graphic designers to modernise both user interface
and also implement a range of new features whilst replacing redundant code. <a target="\_blank"href="https://branditglobal.com/#brandit-demo-video">See more..</a></p>
